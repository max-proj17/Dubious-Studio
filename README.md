## Summary
Welcome to Dubious Studio, where creativity meets technology! Dubious Studio is an innovative assistive drawing desktop application meticulously designed for both budding and professional artists. Our platform seamlessly integrates the prowess of Generative AI and cutting-edge Deep Learning technologies to revolutionize artistic workflows and elevate creative expressions.

## Inspiration
The idea for Dubious Studio was born out of a desire to bridge the gap between imagination and reality. We realized that while there are numerous tools available for artists and designers, there was a lack of intuitive platforms that could combine art tools and the power of AI to help the artists bring their vision to life.

## What it does
Dubious Studio is a cutting-edge application that allows users to:
- Convert hand-drawn sketches into vibrant, detailed images with the power of AI.
- Utilize generative AI to transform textual descriptions into corresponding visual representations.
- Provide a comprehensive toolbox for artists to enhance and modify their creations.

## How we built it
The foundation of Dubious Studio is built on Python using PyQt6, which provides a robust framework for GUI applications. The AI functionalities are powered by [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) and [Clipdrop.co](https://clipdrop.co/). Additionally, we incorporated features like color palettes, erasers, and various brush styles to ensure the program is actually useable by real artists.

## Challenges we ran into
- Ensuring that the application was user-friendly while still offering as advanced features as possible in the given timeframe.
- Handling different types of input, from sketches to text, and ensuring accurate output.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Successfully integrating AI-powered sketch-to-image and text-to-image functionalities.
- Creating an intuitive user interface that caters to both novice and experienced artists.
- Receiving positive feedback from early users, affirming the potential of Dubious Studio.

## What we learned
- The intricacies of integrating AI models into desktop applications.
- The importance of user experience and feedback in shaping the direction of software development.
- The vast potential of AI in revolutionizing the way we approach design and creativity.

## What's next for [60] - Dubious Studio
- Add a plethora of other art tools (fill, select, layer functionality)
- Integrating the popular `.xcf` file format to enable cross-compatibility with other art programs such as GIMP.
